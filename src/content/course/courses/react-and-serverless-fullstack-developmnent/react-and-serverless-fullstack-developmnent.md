I also found this course on Udemy... what gives?

Udemy is an amazing platform, but from my perspective as a content creator, it's not ideal. I don't have direct control over pricing, and the engagement level with students isn't as high.

By moving my courses to Podia, I have a lot more control and flexibility in how I create content. So, to make it worth your while, I'm going to add a few extra benefits for enrolling on Podia.

- exclusive Discord channel for conversations
- exclusive live QandA sessions
- extra videos for cool new features

If you still want to take the course on Udemy, feel free. The core content will remain the same on both platforms.

### Do you have any other courses?

Why yes, I do. You can find a full list of courses at https://www.jamesqquick.com/courses/
