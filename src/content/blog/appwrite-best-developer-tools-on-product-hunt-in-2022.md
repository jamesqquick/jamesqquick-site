If you're familiar with [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com/), then you know it's the go-to platform for releasing new products and getting upvotes to generate hype. Recently, they released their [Golden Kitty Awards for 2022](https://www.producthunt.com/golden-kitty-awards/hall-of-fame), and the product that won the #1 Best Developer Tool is pretty exciting. Let's check it out!

## What is Appwrite?

[Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) is a 100% open-source alternative to Firebase. While Firebase and other alternatives offer features like database, authentication, and real-time data to make building applications easier, Appwrite takes care of that boilerplate stuff for you.

This award-winning tool makes it much easier and better to build applications. And it's not just us saying that; the community spoke for itself by voting Appwrite #1 in the Product Hunt Golden Kitty Awards.

You can check out the features of Appwrite on their website. It offers various features which enable developers to build and customize applications easily. Additionally, the JavaScript SDK that comes with the tool makes it easier to work with all functionalities and sets of features that are available from the front-end, as the back-end stuff is taken care of by Appwrite.

## Appwrite's Impact on App Developers

Some developers prefer to build everything from scratch, and they want full control over everything they do. However, Appwrite offers a better alternative in terms of time-saving and productivity. You don't have to spend hours, days, or even weeks developing a user management system or an authentication process. Appwrite offers these features, so you can focus on the core aspect of your application.

Moreover, Appwrite's features like storage and access control can save developers a lot of time and effort. The fact that Appwrite has won the Best Developer Tool Award from Product Hunt only reinforces its impact on app developers.

## What's Next?

If you're excited about Appwrite like we are, below are some things you can expect:

- You can install Appwrite somewhere on your computer using Docker or create an image in Digital Ocean.
- Appwrite is also working on releasing its Cloud platform in the near future, which would allow developers to access all the features of Appwrite from their own dashboard.
- I’ll be doing more Appwrite videos in the near future.
- I’ll let you know when Appwrite's Cloud platform is ready for launch.

In the meantime, please let me know what sort of content you would like to see built with Appwrite. I’m particularly interested in real-time data and serverless functions.

## Conclusion

Appwrite is undoubtedly a valuable tool for app developers looking to save time and avoid the tedious, time-consuming process of developing boilerplate features from scratch. The fact that Appwrite won the Best Developer Tool Award from Product Hunt only reinforces its potential, and we're excited to continue exploring this tool in future tutorials.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to the field, Appwrite offers a simpler, more efficient approach to building applications, enabling you to focus on the core aspect of your application.
