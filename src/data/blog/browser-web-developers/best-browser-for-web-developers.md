In this blog post, we will explore some of the features that make Polypane an indispensable tool for web developers.

## Introduction to Polypane

Polypane is a browser that offers a unique approach to web development. It is specifically designed for developing and testing websites, making sure that all aspects of the site are up to par before deploying it to production. Polypane offers numerous tools for web developers, including visual, accessibility, and testing perspectives.

Polypane's inspect element feature offers similar information to what you would find in other developer tools like Chrome, but thereâ€™s one particular feature that is incredibly useful. It allows you to inspect an element and view the details across different viewports. This is perfect for confirming that your responsive site is appropriately updating css properties like font size, padding, etc. across the viewports.

### Screenshot Feature

Polypane's screenshot feature is a significant time-saver for web developers. With the click of a button, users can take a screenshot of their entire website, without having to scroll up and down. This feature also enables developers to annotate their screenshots, add stickers, and crop them as needed. The screenshot feature can help web developers showcase their work to clients or colleagues, improving collaboration and communication.
