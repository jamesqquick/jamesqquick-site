As a blogger, managing your embedded Markdown can be quite a hassle, but what if we told you that a VS Code extension could change everything? Meet the Front Matter Extension – the headless EMS right inside your editor.

## Embedded Markdown vs Headless CMS

First, let's talk a bit about embedded Markdown. This is the practice of writing Markdown for each post and embedding it right inside your source code. With the right setup, this allows you to have complete control over your content. However, creating new posts can be quite a hassle. You have to manually copy and paste the metadata, generate a slug, add images, tags, and more.

On the other hand, a headless CMS separates the content from the presentation. This means that you don't have to manage Markdown files directly. However, this type of setup means you don’t have the type of control you would have with Markdown which is embedded in your repository.

## Introducing the Front Matter Extension

## View all Metadata in one Place

This makes it easier to add or update information like the post title, description, or publish date. You even get an image previewer of the cover image.

## Generate Optimized Slugs

Creating optimized slugs can be tricky, especially if you're not familiar with SEO best practices. With the Front Matter Extension, you can generate slugs automatically and remove useless words like "the" or "a". This helps ensure that your URLs are both readable and SEO-friendly.

## Manage Tags with Ease
