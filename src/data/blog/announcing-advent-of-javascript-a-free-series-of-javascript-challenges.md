I'm super happy to announce a new FREE set of JavaScript challenges called [Advent of JavaScript](https://adventofjs.com/) 🎉 For 24 days, you'll get to develop your JavaScript skills with one new challenge each day. Each challenge includes:

- All the HTML and CSS you need to get started, allowing you to **focus on the JavaScript**
- A brief on how to get started, ways to push yourself, and steps to help you get started

> Although this series kicked off on December 1st, you can [sign up](https://adventofjs.com/) at any time and still **get access to all of the challenges**.

This course is powered by the [Compressed.fm podcast](https://compressed.fm/), meaning myself and my amazing co-host, Amy Dutton, are the creators. We really hope that you enjoy it!

> Interested in learning CSS also? Check out [Advent of CSS](https://www.adventofcss.com).

## Who Is It For?

These challenges are perfect for beginner to intermediate developers who want to become more comfortable with their JavaScript skills.

> **Before accepting this challenge, you really should know basic JavaScript.**

You learn best through implementation. Once you’ve applied your knowledge to a specific project, learning concepts are solidified.

## What Kinds of Challenges Are There?

We've created a variety of challenges to give you practice with different parts of JavaScript.

- DOM manipulation
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Working with API calls
- Working with JavaScript Arrays

These are topics that I consider core to the language itself (and web development in general), so each of these challenges will help you level up your JavaScript skills!

## Want Help?

Don't worry we have you covered! While the challenges themselves are completely free, you do have the ability to upgrade to get the solution code AND videos explaining how to build it. I highly recommend attempting to go through these challenges on your own first, **but there's nothing wrong with needing a little bit of help**.

## How Do I Sign Up?

If you're interested, you can sign up at [https://adventofjs.com/](https://adventofjs.com/). If you do, I would love to hear about your progress and any questions you have. You can share updates on Twitter with the hashtag #**adventofjs** and ask questions in the [Learn Build Teach Discord Server](https://learnbuildteach.com/) for help.
