Delivering modern web experiences requires more than just performance—it demands a Developer Experience (DX) that makes complex rendering patterns approachable. In this talk, we’ll explore what it takes to build a library that supports server components, streaming, and partial pre-rendering, with DX as the top priority. Through live code snippets, we’ll uncover how these techniques shape the way pages are brought to life for users. Together, we’ll learn how to design tools that balance cutting-edge rendering with simplicity and joy for developers.
