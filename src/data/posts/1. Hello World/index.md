As a developer, there's no other way to start something new than with "Hello World". Although I've blogged a ton in the past, this is the first post on my personal site. So, without further adieu...

> Hi, I'm James Q Quick, and I am a **Developer, Speaker, and Teacher**!

You might be wondering about the second "Q". My middle name is Quentin. Q's are unique so why not embrace them! :)

## Why I'm Here

So, what am I doing here? Although I have written tons of technical posts, I need an outlet for more **soft skills/personal stuff**. I can't expect someone else to publish material that only pertains to me and my experiences, can I? That said, I am going to be writing here for two reasons.

1. Let you get to know me better
2. Share my experiences in the hopes that you get something out of it

I truly believe in building a community of learning, and I'm hoping these posts will help to foster that!

## Learn Build Teach

Learn Build Teach is my motto and the name of my online platform where I create content on Web Development, Design, and Developer Tools. If you're looking for my more technical content, then head on over to [LearnBuildTeach.com](https://www.learnbuildteach.com)

## Where to Find Me

If you're reading this post, then you've already found my personal site. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jamesqquick) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jamesqquick/). I am big in the development community in Memphis and speak at conferences across the country.
