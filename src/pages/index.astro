        With over 10 years of experience teaching students, my passion for
        teaching developers has led me to full-time Technical Content Creation.
      </p><p class="mb-4 text-lg">
        I believe in work-life balance, personal happiness, and empowering
        others to take control of their career. My personal philosophy of "Learn
        Build Teach" has blossomed into a growing <Link

        /> of aspiring and established developers focused on helping each other succeed.

      <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
        I also co-host a weekly podcast about web design and development called
        <Link href="https://compressed.fm/" text="Compressed.fm" /> and publish weekly
